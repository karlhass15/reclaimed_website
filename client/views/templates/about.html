        Some reclaimed wood comes from barns in the countryside, however I choose to primarily create with
        wood from shipping pallets.  What life does a barn have?  A pallet might start its life in ports of
        Bangkok carrying exotic spices to China, then piled with electronics headed for Switzerland where
        it’s loaded with secret cargo bound for the US.  Dozens of trips, fortunate and abysmal climates and
        inconceivable amounts of abuse leaving beautiful scars.  Every board I use has wonder and a story that
        finds a final resting place as functional art. I am Reclaimed Art Craftsman. </div>

            Pallet wood gives me a look and feel that no other wood can because of the life it’s had. Like many
            of our lives it’s left bent, broken and warped.  However, given the proper treatments it presents like
            no other.  Most craftsman would assume I’m nuts for even trying to work with this material, but I’ve
            figured out several different processes and conditionings that allow me to create incredible things
            out of the wood.  This makes the creation time very extended, but well worth it especially since we are
            saving trees.  Besides the recycling efforts I also give 10% of every commission to Plant a Tree USA.</div>
